Notes: The distances are stored in a vector, until the end when the entire vector is accumulated, and then stored into a local variable, and then cleaned out for the next list. There is a stray pointer needed for the forward list. It shouldn't be dangerous, so long as it is taken into account for naming conventions later on. I shifted around some access specifiers for use in my implementation, but it was just some private members shifted to protected, for inheritance. Should still be secure for the most part.
